## Test Alarm Right Now

### Create Test Alarm via API:

```bash
# Replace YOUR_USER_ID with your actual user ID
curl -X POST https://drillos-production.up.railway.app/v1/alarms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-user-id: demo-user-123" \
  -d '{
    "label": "TEST ALARM NOW",
    "rrule": "FREQ=ONCE;DTSTART=2025-10-05T22:30:00Z",
    "tone": "strict"
  }'
```

**Change the DTSTART time to 1 minute from now in UTC!**

Then wait 1 minute and check:
1. Do you get a notification?
2. Check Railway logs for: `‚è∞ Scan alarms processed: 1`
