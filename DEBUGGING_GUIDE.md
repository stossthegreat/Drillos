## ❓ WHAT TO TEST NOW

### Test 1: Frequency Dropdown
**Steps:**
1. Open app
2. Tap "+" to create new habit
3. Look for "Repeat" dropdown
4. **Does it show: daily, weekdays, everyN, custom?**

**Expected:** ✅ Should see all 4 options
**If not:** ❌ App didn't reload the new code

---

### Test 2: Weekdays Schedule
**Steps:**
1. Create a habit with "Repeat: weekdays"
2. Set reminder for 1 minute from now
3. Save the habit
4. **Does it appear in "Today" list?**
5. **Tomorrow (if weekend): Does it disappear?**

**Expected:** ✅ Only shows Monday-Friday
**If not:** ❌ Schedule logic broken

---

### Test 3: Alarm Firing
**Steps:**
1. Create habit with reminder enabled
2. Set time for 1 minute from now
3. Save
4. Wait 1 minute
5. **Do you get a notification?**
6. **Check Railway logs for:** `⏰ Scan alarms processed: 1`

**Expected:** ✅ Notification appears
**If not:** ❌ Worker still not running

---

### Test 4: Task Scheduling
**Steps:**
1. Create a TASK (not habit)
2. **Can you see the "Repeat" dropdown?**
3. Try setting it to "weekdays"
4. Save
5. **Does task appear today?**

**Expected:** ✅ Tasks can be scheduled
**If not:** ❌ Need to force refresh the app

---

## 🚨 IF NOTHING WORKS

### Possibility 1: App Didn't Reload
**Flutter apps need to be rebuilt after code changes!**

```bash
# Stop the app completely
# Then rebuild:
cd /home/felix/drillos
flutter clean
flutter run
```

### Possibility 2: Railway Didn't Redeploy
**Check Railway dashboard:**
1. Go to railway.app
2. Check "Deployments" tab
3. Look for latest commit: `"CRITICAL FIX: Import worker..."`
4. **Is it "Active"?**

If not deployed:
- Manually trigger redeploy in Railway
- Or push an empty commit: `git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger redeploy"`

### Possibility 3: Worker Import Issue
**Check Railway logs for:**
```
🔧 Scheduler worker initialized and listening for jobs...
✅ Scheduler jobs registered
```

**If you DON'T see this:**
- Worker import failed
- Check for TypeScript errors in Railway build logs

---

## 📊 QUICK STATUS CHECK

Run these commands to verify what's deployed:

```bash
# 1. Check local file has the fix
grep "import './workers/scheduler.worker'" backend/src/server.ts

# 2. Check git has the fix
git log --oneline -1

# 3. Check Railway deployment status
# (Go to railway.app dashboard)
```

---

## 🎯 MOST LIKELY ISSUE

Based on "nothing works" but habits ARE being created:

**The Flutter app needs to be rebuilt!**

The backend fixes are deployed, but your local Flutter app is still running the OLD code with:
- ❌ No frequency dropdown for tasks
- ❌ No "custom" option
- ❌ Old UI code

**SOLUTION:**
```bash
# Kill the app
# Rebuild:
cd /home/felix/drillos
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

---

## 🔥 TELL ME SPECIFICALLY

1. **Can you see the "Repeat" dropdown?** YES / NO
2. **Does it have "custom" option?** YES / NO
3. **Can tasks have schedules?** YES / NO
4. **Do alarms fire?** YES / NO
5. **Did you rebuild the Flutter app?** YES / NO

Once you answer these, I'll know exactly what's wrong! 🎯
